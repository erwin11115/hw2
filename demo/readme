In this assignment, you will need to do the following:

(Inputs) Add buttons on the bread board (as DigitalIn): up, down and select.
(Display) Create a selection display on uLCD to select from a few frequencies by your choice, e.g., 100Hz, 200Hz, etc.
(Generate waveform) Use DAC to generate a wave form with the chosen frequency and pass the generated signal through a RC low pass filter.
(Measure) Use Picoscope to measure the generated wave form.
(Sample) Sample the generated wave form and send the value to PC/Python.
(Analysis) Analyze the captured waveform: show frequency response and wave on screen with Matplotlib.
